# 22. Minimize Deviation in Array (#1675)  -hard
- hard
- You are given an array nums of n positive integers.
```
You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

If the element is even, divide it by 2.
For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be [1,2,3,2].
If the element is odd, multiply it by 2.
For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be [2,2,3,4].
The deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.

  - getMaxOddNumber : this value will not changed. all values are compared with MaxOddNumber. 
  - do2() : fold all even number until below maxOddNumber if deviation will reduce
    - maxOddNumber보다 큰 짝수들은 모두 deviation이 기존 것보다 작아질때 반씩 줄여준다/접어준다.
      - (deviation = maxOddNumber - evenNumber) > (deviation = maxOddNumber - evenNumber//2)
  - do3() : reverse direction of do2().    all double until below maxOddNumber.   but it is not optimized. (TODO)
  - do4() : 4-1 is basic, but we should do more if we can get minimal deviation as we change 4-2 and 4-3
    - 4-1 : rearrange nums[0] and nums[-1] continuously if changed
    - 4-2 : try multiple changes apply above maxOddNumber to fold(//2)
      - maxOddNumber 보다 큰 수에 대해서 num[-1]부터 maxOddNumber까지 모든 수를 한개씩 효과가 있는지 본다. 
    - 4-3 : try multiple changes apply below maxOddNumber to double(*2)
      - maxOddNumber 보다 작은 수에 대해서 num[0]부터 maxOddNumber까지 모든 수를 한개씩 효과가 있는지 본다.

# 24. All Divisions With the Highest Score of a Binary Array - medium
- medium
- You are given a 0-indexed binary array nums of length n. nums can be divided at index i (where 0 <= i <= n) into two arrays (possibly empty) numsleft and numsright:
  - numsleft has all the elements of nums between index 0 and i - 1 (inclusive), while numsright has all the elements of nums between index i and n - 1 (inclusive).
    - If i == 0, numsleft is empty, while numsright has all the elements of nums.
    - If i == n, numsleft has all the elements of nums, while numsright is empty.
    - The division score of an index i is the sum of the number of 0's in numsleft and the number of 1's in numsright.
  - Return all distinct indices that have the highest possible division score. You may return the answer in any order.

# 29. Compare Version Numbers (#165) - medium
- medium 
- Given two version numbers, version1 and version2, compare them.
  - Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.
  - To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1.0 is less than version 1.1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1.

# 33. Champagne Tower (#799) - medium
- medium
- We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup of champagne.
  - Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)
  - For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.
  - Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.)

```
Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules:
    Alice first shoots numArrows arrows and then Bob shoots numArrows arrows.
    The points are then calculated as follows:
        The target has integer scoring sections ranging from 0 to 11 inclusive.
        For each section of the target with score k (in between 0 to 11), say Alice and Bob have shot ak and bk arrows on that section respectively. If ak >= bk, then Alice takes k points. If ak < bk, then Bob takes k points.
        However, if ak == bk == 0, then nobody takes k points.
    For example, if Alice and Bob both shot 2 arrows on the section with score 11, then Alice takes 11 points. On the other hand, if Alice shot 0 arrows on the section with score 11 and Bob shot 2 arrows on that same section, then Bob takes 11 points.
You are given the integer numArrows and an integer array aliceArrows of size 12, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. Now, Bob wants to maximize the total number of points he can obtain.
Return the array bobArrows which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. The sum of the values in bobArrows should equal numArrows.
If there are multiple ways for Bob to earn the maximum total points, return any one of them.

- problem :
  - A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
    - For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are considered permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [3,1,2], [2,3,1].
  - The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
    - For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
    - Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
    - While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

- medium 
- problem :
  - According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
  - The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
    - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
    - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
    - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
    - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
  - The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.

    - boolean hasNext() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
    - int next() Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.
  - Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST.

      - The average time is computed from all the previous traveling times from startStation to endStation that happened directly, meaning a check in at startStation followed by a check out from endStation.
      - The time it takes to travel from startStation to endStation may be different from the time it takes to travel from endStation to startStation.
      - There will be at least one customer that has traveled from startStation to endStation before getAverageTime is called.
  - You may assume all calls to the checkIn and checkOut methods are consistent. If a customer checks in at time t1 then checks out at time t2, then t1 < t2. All events happen in chronological order.

  - n×n의 행렬로 지형도가 표시된 산이 있다. 행렬의 원소의 값은 양의 정수 값으로 그 위치에서의 높이를 말해준다.등산가들은 산의 바깥지역(높이 0)으로부터 목적지에 도달하기 위하여 가장 경제적인 루트를 탐색하려고 한다. 경제적인 경로란 힘을 가장 적게 들이고 목적지까지 올라갈 수 있는 길을 말한다.
  - 예를 보면서 설명해보자. 다음은 행렬 Mount[5,5]로 표시된 산악지형이다. 산의 목적지는 Mount[3,3]의 위치에 있으며, 그 높이는 6이다. 그리고 이 산의 바깥지역은 모두 해발이 0이다. 등산가가 산에 오르는 시작점의 위치는 산의 바깥지역의 어디에서 시작해도 좋다.
  - 등산가는 어떤 한 지역에서 그 위치에 인접한 네 방향(위, 아래, 왼쪽, 오른쪽)으로만 움직일 수 있다. 인접한 지역으로 움직일 수 있는 경우는 (1) 평지로 이동할 경우, (2) 내려갈 경우, (3) 올라갈 경우의 세 가지이다. 이 세 가지 경우에 필요한 "힘"의 양은 다음과 같이 표현될 수 있다.
    - (1)인접한 같은 높이의 지역을 수평 이동할 경우에는 그냥 평지를 걸어가면 되므로 힘이 전혀 들지 않는다고 가정한다. 예를 들면 Mount[5,2]에서 Mount[5,3]으로 이동하는 경우와 Mount[4,5]에서 Mount[5,5]로 이동하는 경우에는 전혀 힘이 들지 않는다.
    - (2)내리막길을 따라갈 경우(예를 들면, Mount[2,3]에서 Mount[2,2]로 갈 때)에는 그 높이 차이만큼의 힘이 든다. 즉 이 경우에는 5-3=2만큼의 힘이 든다.
    - (3)오르막길을 오를 경우에는 이동할 두 지역의 높이 차의 제곱만큼의 힘이 든다. 즉 Mount[1,2]에서 Mount[1,3]으로 갈 경우는 (4-2)2=4 만큼의 힘이 든다.
  - Input
    - 첫째 줄에는 산의 크기인 Mount[n,n]의 n값이 주어지고, 두 번째 줄에는 목적지의 위치 Mount[y,x]의 y, x값이 주어진다.
    - 단, Mount[n,n]에서 n은 100이하이고, 각 지형의 최대 높이는 50이하라고 가정한다.
    - 그 다음 n개의 줄은 산의 크기에 따른 각 지점의 높이가 양의 정수 값으로 주어진다.
  - Output
    - 첫째 줄에 목적지까지 도달하는 가장 경제적인 경로를 따라 올라가는데 사용된 힘을 출력한다.

# 103. Find Median from Data Stream (#295) - hard / python / 2H / bisect / Top 100 Liked Questions
- hard : bisect
- problem :
  - The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value and the median is the mean of the two middle values.
    - For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
    - For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
  - Implement the MedianFinder class:
    - MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
    - void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.

# 109. Flatten Nested List Iterator (#341) - medium / python / 2H
- medium
- problem :
  - You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.
  - Implement the NestedIterator class:
    - NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) Initializes the iterator with the nested list nestedList.
    - int next() Returns the next integer in the nested list.
    - boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still some integers in the nested list and false otherwise.
  - Your code will be tested with the following pseudocode:
    - initialize iterator with nestedList
    - res = []
    - while iterator.hasNext()
    -     append iterator.next() to the end of res
    - return res
  - If res matches the expected flattened list, then your code will be judged as correct.
  - ```
      Input: nestedList = [[1,2],3,[4,5]]
      Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
      Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,2,3,4,5].

# 130. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (#167) - medium / python / 30M
- medium
- problem :
  - Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
  - Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
  - The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
  - Your solution must use only constant extra space.
  - ```
      Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
      Output: [1,3]
      Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

      Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
      Output: [1,2]
      Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

# 137. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings (#712) - medium / python / Longest Common Subsequence / LCS / (fail)
- medium
- problem :
  - Given two strings s1 and s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.
  - Constraints:
    - 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000
    - s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
  - ```
      Example 1:
      Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"
      Output: 231
      Explanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the sum.
      Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum.
      At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

      Example 2:
      Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"
      Output: 403
      Explanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let",
      adds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.
      Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum.
      At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
      If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.

- solution : 
  - [minimumDeleteSum_v2.py](https://github.com/cheoljoo/problemSolving/blob/master/leetcode/minimumDeleteSum_v2.py) 
  - Approach #1: Dynamic Programming [Accepted] - Intuition and Algorithm
  - Let dp[i][j] be the answer to the problem for the strings s1[i:], s2[j:].
  - When one of the input strings is empty, the answer is the ASCII-sum of the other string. We can calculate this cumulatively using code like dp[i][s2.length()] = dp[i+1][s2.length()] + s1.codePointAt(i).
  - When s1[i] == s2[j], we have dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j+1] as we can ignore these two characters.
  - When s1[i] != s2[j], we will have to delete at least one of them. We'll have dp[i][j] as the minimum of the answers after both deletion options.
  - The solutions presented will use bottom-up dynamic programming.

# 138. String to Integer (atoi) (#8) - medium / python / 30M / Top Interview Questions
- medium
- problem :
  - Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
  - The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:
    - Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
    - Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
    - Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
    - Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
    - If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be clamped to -2^31, and integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be clamped to 2^31 - 1.
    - Return the integer as the final result.
  - Note:
    - Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
    - Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.
  - Constraints:
    - 0 <= s.length <= 200
    - s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.
  - ```
      Input: s = "4193 with words"
      Output: 4193
      Explanation:
      Step 1: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
              ^
      Step 2: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
              ^
      Step 3: "4193 with words" ("4193" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
                  ^
      The parsed integer is 4193.
      Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.

# 143. Wiggle Subsequence (#376) - medium / python / 10M / 2022.07.03
- medium
- problem :
  - A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.
    - For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
    - In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.
  - A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
  - Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.
  - Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 1000 / 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
  - ```
      Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
      Output: 6
      Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).

      Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
      Output: 7
      Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
      One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).

# 157. Sort the Matrix Diagonally (#1329) - medium / python / 20M / 2022.08.28 / partial sort
- medium
- problem :
  - A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end. For example, the matrix diagonal starting from mat[2][0], where mat is a 6 x 3 matrix, includes cells mat[2][0], mat[3][1], and mat[4][2].
  - Given an m x n matrix mat of integers, sort each matrix diagonal in ascending order and return the resulting matrix.
  - Constraints : m == mat.length / n == mat[i].length / 1 <= m, n <= 100 / 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100
  - ```
      Input: mat = [[3,3,1,1],[2,2,1,2],[1,1,1,2]]

- medium
- problem :
  - Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.
  - Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.
  - Constraints : The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5]. / Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].
  - ```
      Example 1:
      Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
      Output: 4
      Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
      Root Node (3) is always a good node.
      Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
      Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
      Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

      Example 2:
      Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
      Output: 3
      Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.

      Example 3:
      Input: root = [1]
      Output: 1

# 164. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree (#987) - hard / python / 1H / 2022.09.04 / sort / tree traverse
- hard
- problem :
  - Given the root of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
  - For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0).
  - The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.
  - Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
  - Constraints : The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. / 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
  - ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/29/vtree1.jpg)
  - ```
      Example 1:
      Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
      Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
      Explanation:
      Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.
      Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.
      Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.
      Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.

      Example 2:
      Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
      Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
      Explanation:
      Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.
      Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.
      Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.
                1 is at the top, so it comes first.
                5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.
      Column 1: Only node 3 is in this column.
      Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.

      Example 3:
      Input: root = [1,2,3,4,6,5,7]
      Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
      Explanation:
      This case is the exact same as example 2, but with nodes 5 and 6 swapped.
      Note that the solution remains the same since 5 and 6 are in the same location and should be ordered by their values.

# 167. Integer to Roman (#12) - medium / python / 10M / 2022.09.07 / table
- medium
- problem :
  - Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
  - ```
      Symbol       Value
      I             1
      V             5
      X             10
      L             50
      C             100
      D             500
      M             1000
    ```
  - For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
  - Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
    - I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
    - X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
    - C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
  - Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.
  - Constraints : 1 <= num <= 3999
  - ```
      Input: num = 3
      Output: "III"
      Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.

      Input: num = 58
      Output: "LVIII"
      Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

      Input: num = 1994

# 169. Bag of Tokens (#948) - medium / python / 30M / 2022.09.12 / sort
- medium
- problem :
  - You have an initial power of power, an initial score of 0, and a bag of tokens where tokens[i] is the value of the ith token (0-indexed).
  - Your goal is to maximize your total score by potentially playing each token in one of two ways:
    - If your current power is at least tokens[i], you may play the ith token face up, losing tokens[i] power and gaining 1 score.
    - If your current score is at least 1, you may play the ith token face down, gaining tokens[i] power and losing 1 score.
  - Each token may be played at most once and in any order. You do not have to play all the tokens.
  - Return the largest possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.
  - Constraints : 0 <= tokens.length <= 1000 / 0 <= tokens[i], power < 10^4
  - ```
      Example 1:
      Input: tokens = [100], power = 50
      Output: 0
      Explanation: Playing the only token in the bag is impossible because you either have too little power or too little score.

      Example 2:
      Input: tokens = [100,200], power = 150
      Output: 1
      Explanation: Play the 0th token (100) face up, your power becomes 50 and score becomes 1.
      There is no need to play the 1st token since you cannot play it face up to add to your score.

      Example 3:
      Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200
      Output: 2
      Explanation: Play the tokens in this order to get a score of 2:
      1. Play the 0th token (100) face up, your power becomes 100 and score becomes 1.
      2. Play the 3rd token (400) face down, your power becomes 500 and score becomes 0.
      3. Play the 1st token (200) face up, your power becomes 300 and score becomes 1.

# 170. UTF-8 Validation (#393) - medium / python / 20M / 2022.09.13
- medium
- problem :
  - Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).
  - A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:
    - For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
    - For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.
  - This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:
    - ```
        Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                          |              (binary)
      --------------------+-----------------------------------------
                1          |   0xxxxxxx
                2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
                3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
                4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
    x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.
    Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.
      ```
  - Constraints : 1 <= data.length <= 2 * 10^4 / 0 <= data[i] <= 255
  - ```
      Example 1:
      Input: data = [197,130,1]
      Output: true
      Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
      It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.

      Example 2:
      Input: data = [235,140,4]
      Output: false
      Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
      The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
      The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
      But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.

# 173. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations (#1770) - medium / python / 1H / 2022.09.16 / dynamic programming
- medium
- problem :
  - You are given two integer arrays nums and multipliers of size n and m respectively, where n >= m. The arrays are 1-indexed.
  - You begin with a score of 0. You want to perform exactly m operations. On the ith operation (1-indexed), you will:
    - Choose one integer x from either the start or the end of the array nums.
    - Add multipliers[i] * x to your score.
    - Remove x from the array nums.
  - Return the maximum score after performing m operations.
  - Constraints : n == nums.length / m == multipliers.length / 1 <= m <= 10^3 / m <= n <= 10^5 / -1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000
  - ```

# 174. Design Circular Queue (#622) - medium / python / 8M / 2022.09.26
- medium
- problem :
  - Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".
  - One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.
  - Implementation the MyCircularQueue class:
    - MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.
    - int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
    - int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
    - boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
    - boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
    - boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
    - boolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
  - You must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language. 
  - Constraints : 1 <= k <= 1000 / 0 <= value <= 1000 / At most 3000 calls will be made to enQueue, deQueue, Front, Rear, isEmpty, and isFull.

- problem :
  - You are given an array time where time[i] denotes the time taken by the ith bus to complete one trip.
  - Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.
  - You are also given an integer totalTrips, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least totalTrips trips.
  - Constraints : 1 <= time.length <= 10^5 / 1 <= time[i], totalTrips <= 10^7
  - ```
    Input: time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    - At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. 
      The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
    - At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0]. 
      The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
    - At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1]. 
      The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.

# 183. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers (#129) - medium / python / 20M / 2023.03.14 / tree traverse
- medium
- problem :
  - You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.
  - Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.
    - For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
  - Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
  - A leaf node is a node with no children.
  - Constraints : The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. / 0 <= Node.val <= 9 / The depth of the tree will not exceed 10.
  - ```
    Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
    Output: 1026
    Explanation:
    The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
    The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
    The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
    Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

# 184. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) (#208) - medium / python / 20M / 2023.03.17
- medium
- problem :
  - A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.
  - Implement the Trie class:
    - Trie() Initializes the trie object.
    - void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
    - boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
    - boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.
  - ```
    Input
    ["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
    [[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
    Output
    [null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

    Explanation
    Trie trie = new Trie();
    trie.insert("apple");
    trie.search("apple");   // return True
    trie.search("app");     // return False
    trie.startsWith("app"); // return True
    trie.insert("app");
    trie.search("app");     // return True

# 185. Design Browser History (#1472) - medium / python / 20M / 2023.03.18
- medium
- problem :
  - You have a browser of one tab where you start on the homepage and you can visit another url, get back in the history number of steps or move forward in the history number of steps.
  - Implement the BrowserHistory class:
    - BrowserHistory(string homepage) Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.
    - void visit(string url) Visits url from the current page. It clears up all the forward history.
    - string back(int steps) Move steps back in history. If you can only return x steps in the history and steps > x, you will return only x steps. Return the current url after moving back in history at most steps.
    - string forward(int steps) Move steps forward in history. If you can only forward x steps in the history and steps > x, you will forward only x steps. Return the current url after forwarding in history at most steps.
  - ```
    Input:
    ["BrowserHistory","visit","visit","visit","back","back","forward","visit","forward","back","back"]
    [["leetcode.com"],["google.com"],["facebook.com"],["youtube.com"],[1],[1],[1],["linkedin.com"],[2],[2],[7]]
    Output:
    [null,null,null,null,"facebook.com","google.com","facebook.com",null,"linkedin.com","google.com","leetcode.com"]

    Explanation:
    BrowserHistory browserHistory = new BrowserHistory("leetcode.com");
    browserHistory.visit("google.com");       // You are in "leetcode.com". Visit "google.com"
    browserHistory.visit("facebook.com");     // You are in "google.com". Visit "facebook.com"
    browserHistory.visit("youtube.com");      // You are in "facebook.com". Visit "youtube.com"
    browserHistory.back(1);                   // You are in "youtube.com", move back to "facebook.com" return "facebook.com"
    browserHistory.back(1);                   // You are in "facebook.com", move back to "google.com" return "google.com"
    browserHistory.forward(1);                // You are in "google.com", move forward to "facebook.com" return "facebook.com"
    browserHistory.visit("linkedin.com");     // You are in "facebook.com". Visit "linkedin.com"
    browserHistory.forward(2);                // You are in "linkedin.com", you cannot move forward any steps.
    browserHistory.back(2);                   // You are in "linkedin.com", move back two steps to "facebook.com" then to "google.com". return "google.com"
    browserHistory.back(7);                   // You are in "google.com", you can move back only one step to "leetcode.com". return "leetcode.com"
